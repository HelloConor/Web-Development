                                <p>Alexievich was born to a Belarusian father in military service and a Ukrainian mother; both were teachers. From 1967 to 1972 she studied journalism at the University of Minsk; afterward she worked as a reporter in Byaroza, Brest region, near the Polish border, and then in Minsk.</p>

                                <h1>1983</h1>
                                <p>Deemed unpatriotic and seditious by authorities, her early works remained unpublished until the political reformation in the mid-1980s initiated by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s liberalizing policy of perestroika.</p>

                                <p>In 1985 Alexievich published U voyny ne zhenskoe litso (War’s Unwomanly Face; also translated as The Unwomanly Face of War: An Oral History of Women in World War II), an investigative study that chronicled the lives of Soviet women during World War II, followed that same year by Poslednie svideteli (Last Witnesses: An Oral History of the Children of World War II), a collection of reminiscences of war as seen through the eyes of children. Based on detailed research and interviews with hundreds of women, U voyny ne zhenskoe litso earned widespread critical recognition and established her reputation as an “oral historian” of collective identity.</p>

                                <p>Published in 1990, Tsinkovye malchiki (Zinky Boys: Soviet Voices from a Forgotten War; also translated as Zinky Boys: Soviet Voices from the Afghanistan War) exposed the hidden, undocumented futility of the Soviet intervention (1979–89) in the Afghan War (1978–92) and served to demystify the role of nationalism and Soviet autonomy. The title referred to the zinc coffins used by the military to return the Soviet dead.</p>

                                <p>In 1997 she published Chernobylskaya molitva: khronika budushchego (Voices from Chernobyl: Chronicle of the Future; also translated as Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster), which confronted the devastating consequences of the Chernobyl disaster as told by witnesses and victims of the catastrophic nuclear power station accident.</p>

                                <p>Labeled a dissident journalist with anti-Soviet sentiments, she experienced intimidation as well as harassment: her writing was subjected to censorship or banned from publication, she was publicly denounced for “defamation” and “slander,” and her opposition to the political regime in Belarus forced her into an extended period of self-imposed exile. Nevertheless, she persisted on her chosen path. She enlarged the scope of her creative vision with the publication in 2013 of Vremya sekond chend (Secondhand Time: The Last of the Soviets), which examined the legacy of communism in the aftermath of the demise of the Soviet Union.</p>
